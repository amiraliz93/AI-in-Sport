## First examination is predicting the players performance by supervise ML Algorithm

Overall rating is the most important feature for each football player. By evaluating this, a great player will be distinguished from another.

This report will implement and design two models for classifying and predicting players over the Overall_rating attribute. 

In this scenario, I attend to train the regression model to predict the overall rating by utilising the other features and classifying players into different groups based on features that have a high correlation to Overall_rating. 

The linear regression was chosen for two main reasons. Firstly, a Linear Regression algorithm is an excellent option for estimating the value of a variable based on the values of other attributes (About Linear Regression - United Kingdom | IBM, 2021). It means we have two types of variables: a dependent variable that is supposed to predict and an independent variable utilised to predict.

Second, the relationship between our features and Overall_rating is linear, appropriate for this model because features in linear regression should have a linear relationship

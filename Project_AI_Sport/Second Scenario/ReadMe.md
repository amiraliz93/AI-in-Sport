## Examination 2
The second examination categorises players into similar groups based on some characteristics.

This study intends to uncover some players' skills that are highly associated with an overall rating and group them into comparable groups based on these characteristics. What if we could group players with 5 or 6 skills together and predict their groups only based on these skills? 

Which features we should select to reach the best cluster. The five features that had the highest association with the overall rating were selected on the first attempt. We ran across the first issue of figuring out how many categories are suitable for clustering. 

The K-means machine learning method and elbow strategy were employed to meet these criteria to discover the optimal number of clusters for the dataset. In addition, in this report, the Silhouette analysis is used to evaluate the k value we implement in this model.

## Examination 2
The second examination categorises players into similar groups based on some characteristics.

The initial question in this situation is which features are appropriate among the 42 input attributes in this data collection. My goal was to group players based on five characteristics assigned to similar groups with similar overall ratings. I used the k-means technique for clustering and chose five features with a high correlation with total rating, but this does not guarantee that these choices would lead to the best solution. Taking all five traits, for example, will not reveal new information if four of the five attributes are dependent on the remaining one value.

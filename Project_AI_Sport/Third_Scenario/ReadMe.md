## Third Examination
The objective of this paper is to identify competition outcomes based on variables in the match table that represent specific bookmarkers. The bookmarks website has a special rate and ratio for each match's result known odds. In this case, classifier methods are used to predict the outcome of each match based on these odds from different bookmarks. The match table has 115 components, including team information, match stats, and bookmark data. The bookmarks data and some team attributes were preserved to avoid a complex model. Furthermore, some features are removed in the data frame because they have many missed values.
### in this examination I enployed clasification algorithms such as :
  1-  Desicion Tree
  
  2-  Random Forest
  
  3-  Ada Bost
  
  4-  Naive Bayes
  
  5-  SVM
  
  And in the end compare accuracy the different model
